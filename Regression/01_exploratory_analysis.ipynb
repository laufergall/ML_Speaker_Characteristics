    "#### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to assess speakers' social and personality-related characteristics automatically is desired in multiple novel systems that aim at offering individualized services. Recent developments have led to speech assistants with excellent\n",
    "natural language understanding and synthesis capabilities [1]. However, the characterization of individuals and their intentions\n",
    "and behavior still needs to be improved in order to achieve even more human-like communications.\n",
    "\n",
    "[My work](http://www.qu.tu-berlin.de/?id=lfernandez) examines user characterization from their voices, i.e. recognizing their traits (confidence, friendliness, competence, etc.) by the sound of their voices and manner of speaking. \n",

    "#### Speech material and features\n",
    "\n",
    "I will employ the newly released [Nautilus Speaker Characterization (NSC) corpus](http://www.qu.tu-berlin.de/?id=nsc-corpus) [2]. The corpus contains clean conversational speech from 300 German speakers and labels of 34 interpersonal traits (likability, confidence, maturity, etc.) obtained by subjective listening.\n",
    "\n",
    "These data is freely available for non-commercial research at the [CLARIN repository](hdl.handle.net/11022/1009-0000-0007-C05F-6).\n",
    "\n",
    "As speech features I considered the extended Geneva Minimalistic Acoustic Parameter Set (eGeMAPS) for this initial exploratory analysis [3]. The [openSMILE toolkit](http://audeering.com/technology/opensmile/) was employed to extract this speech feature set. Frequency-, energy-, spectral, and temporal-related parameters are extracted from windowed speech. After smoothing over time with a symmetric 3-frame moving average, functionals such as mean, coefficient of variation, and percentiles are computed and included in the final set of 88 speech features.\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository **does not contain speakers' sensible data**, complying with the NSC license. All speakers names were pseudonymised. There is no possibility to retrieve the original recorded speech from the provided material.\n"

    "#### Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to predict speakers' interpersonal traits based on the speech features mentioned above (functionals of F0, loudness, mfccs, jitter, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "I will start by fitting regression models. Let is define the common RMSE (root-mean-square error) and the more robust to outliers MAPE (median absolute percentage) as the metrics for success:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "RMSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_i(y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2}{n}}  \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "MAPE = median(\\left | \\frac{y_i-\\hat{y}_i}{y_i} \\right |)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y_i$ and $\\hat{y_i}$ are the observed and the predicted values for the $i^{th}$ data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible applications of this research can be the adaptation of human-machine spoken dialog systems. The predicted speakers' traits can be strong indicators of their preferences and individual behavior, which could provide cues for dialog adaptation. Systems could dynamically respond by generating different dialog strategies or by synthesizing emotions or personality. Of course, more data apart from the controlled NSC corpus would be necessary for the validation of my results."
